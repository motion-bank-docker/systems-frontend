# libMB Quasar App

> Motion Bank starting point template

## How to use

First [download the template](https://github.com/motionbank/libmb-quasar-app/archive/master.zip)
and unzip it somewhere comfy.

Rename the folder and edit the ``package.json`` file to set your app's name, version and URLs.

In a terminal run
```shell
cd my-great-quasar-app
npm install
```
Now the [metapak-motionbank](https://github.com/motionbank/metapak-motionbank)
should have set up your project, so run ``npm install`` a second time to install all dependencies.

You should now be the proud owner of a barebones Quasar app. Check out it's ``README.md`` for more info.
